This project is a multiplayer game created in Unity.  
It uses Photon Networking library for sending data over the network.  
There are only 2 players; one is host who sets round and communicates with Photon server to synchronize data,  
and second one is an ordinary player who receives data from Photon server.  
Photon server is responsible for data synchronization (interactions) between two players, and receiving and passing data from the host.  
The game is based on once popular game series: "Worms".
